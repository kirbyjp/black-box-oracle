# Black Box Oracle â€” Timestamped Prior Art Disclosure

## ðŸ§­ Alignment & Intent

This repository serves as timestamped prior art for the invention titled *Black Box Oracle*, including its modular architecture for alignment drift tracking, forensic replay, and audit-first AI governance. It is not open-source and is not intended for reuse or redistribution.

The materials hereinâ€”including diagrams, specifications, and provisional patent excerptsâ€”are published to establish public domain knowledge and prevent monopolistic patenting. All rights are reserved.

While not open-source, this work is intended as a foundation for principled collaboration across technical, legal, and regulatory domains. Stakeholders committed to auditability, user agency, and responsible deployment are invited to engage via [GitHub Discussions](#) or by opening an issue tagged `coalition-inquiry`.

No permission is granted to reproduce, modify, distribute, or incorporate this work into derivative projects or patent filings without explicit written consent from the author.

## Patent Draft: MCMC-Based Alignment Drift Tracking

This repository contains a timestamped draft of a modular architecture for alignment drift tracking using periodic MCMC sampling. The design supports forensic replay, audit triggers, and model-agnostic deployment across AI systems.

- **Purpose**: Establish open, defensible standards for AI transparency, legal discovery, and ESG compliance
- **Scope**: Covers drift detection, replayable audit artifacts, and alignment verification across time
- **Status**: Draft patent filed; this version serves as timestamped prior art and coalition reference
- **License**: Custom license included to prevent monopolization and support open coalition use
