## Patent Draft: MCMC-Based Alignment Drift Tracking

This repository contains a timestamped draft of a modular architecture for alignment drift tracking using periodic MCMC sampling. The design supports forensic replay, audit triggers, and model-agnostic deployment across AI systems.

- **Purpose**: Establish open, defensible standards for AI transparency, legal discovery, and ESG compliance
- **Scope**: Covers drift detection, replayable audit artifacts, and alignment verification across time
- **Status**: Draft patent filed; this version serves as timestamped prior art and coalition reference
- **License**: Custom license included to prevent monopolization and support open coalition use

## Modular Architecture Snapshot

This invention supports:
- Periodic sampling via MCMC
- Replayable audit artifacts
- Trigger-based drift detection
- Model-agnostic deployment

These components are described in the patent draft and illustrated via the Alignment Achieved Cube graphic.

## Related Work and Differentiation

While existing systems address aspects of traceability, drift detection, and audit logging, they often do so in isolationâ€”and with significant resource overhead. For example:

- **Concept drift detection frameworks** (e.g., *DDM*, *ADWIN*) monitor statistical shifts in data distributions, but do not trace semantic alignment or the evolution of model reasoning.
- **Audit trail tools** (e.g., *MLflow*, *SageMaker Registry*) log model versions and approvals, yet lack replayable, per-decision logic inspection.
- **Black box interpretability methods** (e.g., *SHAP*, *LIME*) offer feature attributionâ€”not forensic replay or drift-aware reasoning traceability.
- **Enterprise provenance systems** focus on data lineage and telemetry, often requiring heavy infrastructure and vendor lock-in.

This architecture introduces a novel, modular approach to:

- **Alignment drift tracking** â€” semantic, periodic snapshots of model reasoning  
- **Replayable audit trails** â€” inspectable logic chains across time  
- **Model-agnostic deployment** â€” no dependence on specific frameworks or vendors  
- **Lightweight operation** â€” designed for periodic audits, not continuous resource drain  

By unifying these capabilities, it enables **legal-grade forensic inspection** of AI behaviorâ€”without the complexity or cost of existing solutions.
